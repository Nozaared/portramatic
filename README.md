## Portramatic

This is a tool for creating portraits for Owlcat Pathfinder games. The mechanics
are simple, you paste in an URL, you can pan/zoom the images (while maintaining the proper sizing),
and when you are done, the app will export the images for use in the game. 

### Future Features
* A repository (stored here) of known URLs, tags, and croppings
* A way for users to submit images for inclusion in the public library
* A way for the app to copy the portraits into the game folder
