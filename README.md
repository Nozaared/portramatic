## Portramatic

This is a tool for creating portraits for Owlcat Pathfinder games. The mechanics
are simple, you paste in an URL, you can pan/zoom the images (while maintaining the proper sizing),
and when you are done, the app will export the images for use in the game. 

### Future Features
* A repository (stored here) of known URLs, tags, and croppings
* A way for users to submit images for inclusion in the public library
* A way for the app to copy the portraits into the game folder

### Example Usage

In the `output\D066\D066B378F1EB5C3094770B344F95E04C` folder you will then see 3 files:
```
definition.json
Fulllength.png
Medium.png
Small.png
```

Just copy this `D066B378F1EB5C3094770B344F95E04C` folder into:

```
C:\Users\<your-user-name>\AppData\LocalLow\Owlcat Games\Pathfinder Wrath Of The Righteous\Portraits
```

And the portrait will show up in-game.
